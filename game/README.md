This is the first version of the game.

Idea: this is a tile based FPGA type thing with set inputs and outputs.
You make logic circuits in the game to execute and attempt to win.
Build it out by modelling things in Factorio, then balance it for yourself.


Each turn is simultaneous, but make it so you can also have people play async. 

E.g. an async factorio? No enemies, except what other players can produce?
